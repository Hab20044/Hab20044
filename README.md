#### About Me

I am a Results-driven Data Scientist and Frontend Developer with strong expertise in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Web Development. Skilled in turning data into actionable insights and building modern, responsive websites, I combine data science with frontend development to deliver complete, data-powered solutions.

I have worked on real-world projects in data cleaning, clustering, classification, and visualization, and built high-performance websites and dashboards for small businesses, startups, and agencies using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

Currently, I’m focusing on enhancing my skills in AI, data-driven decision-making, and frontend technologies, while working on projects that merge data science with user-friendly design.

I am aspiring to collaborate on impactful projects where I can leverage both my analytical and development skills to create meaningful solutions.

Let’s collaborate to turn data into insights and ideas into interactive web experiences...
